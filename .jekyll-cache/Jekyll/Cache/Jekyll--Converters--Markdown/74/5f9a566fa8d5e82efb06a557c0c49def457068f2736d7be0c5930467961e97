<p>I have been a mathematician as long as I can remember. As a child, I always divided the sweets between the people in our house and blatantly told everybody about that (which obviously embarassed my mother much more often than she would have liked). I tried to teach my grandmother the basic of maths and English at the age of 8, even despite her own unwillingness… My parents were both professors in my hometown university (my father still is), so the carreer path that I have chosen for myself was not unexpected.</p>

<p>But I had my ups and downs in academia: in 2014 I graduated from the National Research University “Higher School of Economics” as a Master of Science in Economics and decided to never set foot in any university ever again. As you have probably guessed, it did not take me a lot of time to reverse my decision. In 2015, I have been accepted at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics and here I am, applying for Assistant Proffesorships five and a half years later.</p>

<p>Since 2015, I have joined the Institute of Finance and Statistics, published a (co-authored) paper in a top-5 journal in my field, presented my project at multiple conferences and conducted numerous seminars for Master as well as PhD students. I have never been more in my place.</p>

<p>But my life does not consist only of research and teaching, I also like to have fun sometimes! You can read about my hobbies in CV, but what you definitely won’t find there is this link: <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/russians-recreate-famous-works-of-art/">Article on Bored Panda</a>. If you read the article, somewhere in the middle of the list you will probably see a familiar face :-) And if you are not convinced by this, then check my <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@missius">TikTok account</a>.
