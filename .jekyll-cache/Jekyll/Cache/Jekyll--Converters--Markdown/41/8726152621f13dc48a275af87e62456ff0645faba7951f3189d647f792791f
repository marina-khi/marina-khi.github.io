<p>I have been a mathematician as long as I can remember myself. As a child, I always divided the sweets between the people in our house and blatantly told everybody about that (which obviously embarassed my mother much more often tha nshe would have liked). I tried to teach my grandmother the basic of maths and English at the age of 8, even despite her own unwillingness‚Ä¶ My mother and my father were both professors in my hometown university, so my choice of carreer path was obvious.</p>

<p>But I had my ups and downs in academia: in 2014 I graduated from the National Research University ‚ÄúHigher School of Economics‚Äù as a Master of Science in Economics and decided to never set foot in any university ever again. As you have probably guessed, it did not take me a lot of time to reverse my decision. In 2015, I have been accepted at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics and here I am, applying for Assistant Proffesorships 5 ahd a half years later.</p>

<p>Since then, I have joined the Institute of Finance and Statistics, published a (co-authored) paper in a top-5 journal in my field and conducted numerous seminars for Master as well as PhD students. I have never been more in my place.</p>

<p>But my life does not consist only of research and teaching, I also like to have fun sometimes! You can read about my hobbies in my CV, but you definitely won‚Äôt find there is this link: <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/russians-recreate-famous-works-of-art/">Article on Bored Panda</a>.
