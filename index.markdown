## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Bonn and a research fellow at the Institute of Finance and Statistics at the Univeristy of Bonn. I am interested in Econometrics and Statistics, specifically in Nonparamteric Statistics and Time Series Analysis. I am also interested in economic applications for statistical methods.

I will be available for job interviews at the EEA and ASSA (online) meetings.
