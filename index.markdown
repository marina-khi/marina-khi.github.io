## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Bonn and a research fellow at the Institute of Finance and Statistics at the Univeristy of Bonn. I am interested in Econometrics and Statistics, specifically in Nonparamteric Statistics, Multscale Hypothesis Testing, Time Series Analysis and Identification. I am also interested in economical application for statistical methods.

I will be available for the job interview at the EEA and ASSA (online) meetings.
