## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Bonn and a research fellow at the Institute of Finance and Statistics at the Univeristy of Bonn. I am interested in Econometrics and Statistics, specifically in Nonparamteric Statistics and Time Series Analysis. I am also interested in economic applications for statistical methods. Please find the short version of my CV [here][1] and my research [here][2].
